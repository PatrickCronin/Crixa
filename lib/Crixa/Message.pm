# ABSTRACT: A Crixa Message

__END__

=pod

=encoding UTF-8

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents a single queue. With RabbitMQ, messages are published to
exchanges, which then routes the message to one or more queues. You then
consume those messages from the queue.

=head1 METHODS

This class provides the following methods:

=head2 $message->ack

This send an acknowledgement for the message on the channel that was used to
receive the message.

=head2 $message->body

This returns the message's body. If the message does not have any
content-encoding set _or_ the message contains an encoding with the string
"utf-8" (case insensitive), then the message is returned as character
data. Otherwise it is returned as binary data.

=head2 Property methods

There are a number of properties that can be associated with a message. This
class provides reader and predicate methods for all properties of the form C<<
$message->foo >> and C<< $message->has_foo >>. None of the properties are
required.

The properties supported are:

=over 4

=item * content_type

=item * content_encoding

=item * correlation_id

=item * reply_to

=item * expiration

=item * message_id

=item * type

=item * user_id

=item * app_id

=item * priority

=item * delivery_mode

=item * timestamp

=item * headers

=back

See the C<publish> method in the L<Crixa::Exchange> docs for more details.

=head2 $message->redelivered

A boolean indicating whether or not the message has already been delivered at
least once. RabbitMQ guarantees that each message will be delivered I<at least
once>, and it is not uncommon for a message to be redelivered before the first
consumer to receive it has had a chance to acknowledge it.

=head2 $message->message_count

The number of messages left in the queue at the time this message was
delivered.

Note that this is only set for messages which are not received via the C<<
Crixa::Queue->consume() >> method.

=head2 $message->routing_key

The routing path on which the message was received.

=head2 $message->exchange

The exchange to which this message was published

=head2 $message->delivery_tag

The delivery tag for a given message. This is used when the C<<
$message->ack() >> method is called.

=head2 $message->consumer_tag

The tag for the consumer associated with the message, if one exists.

Note that this is only set for messages which are received via the C<<
Crixa::Queue->consume() >> method.

=head2 Crixa::Message->new(...)

There is no reason to call this method directly. It will be called by a
L<Crixa::Queue> object to inflate messages into objects.
